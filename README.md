1.  **Data Extraction**: Extracting image data from a zip file.
2.  **Data Exploration**:  Displaying sample images to understand the dataset's characteristics.

##  File Structure

* `Fashion_Recommendation_System.ipynb`:  Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
* `women-fashion.zip`:  (Assumed) Zip file containing the fashion image dataset.
* `women_fashion/`: Directory where the zip file is extracted.
